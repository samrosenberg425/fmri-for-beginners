# fMRI/The BOLD Signal
Now that you are all at least semi-pros on how MRI physics work, we can now go from structural to functional. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging(fMRI) is how we know what parts of the brain are active at certain times in the scanner. 
*How can we take a picture and tell what parts of the brain are active?* Well for starters, you can't do this with the naked eye. If you look at a montage of fMRI images, you will likely see a heterogenous gray blob on your screen that doesn't look like much of anything, but little do you know, it has everything. We just need to use very complicated computer programs to see it for us. 

The **Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) Signal** is how we are able to see what parts of the brain are active. This sounds intimidating, but only before someone like me can explain it in the most simplistic terms. So here is how it works:
- Different parts of your brain are active for different tasks, and when you go from doing nothing to doing something, those regions go from inactive to active
- Neurons use a lot of glucose and oxygen, so as soon as they become active, they need more glucose and oxygen
- These molecules are transported through the blood and our bodies are smart, so to solve this problem, blood flow will be redirected to brain regions that need more nutrients
- Lastly and most importantly, in the fMRI images we can see the difference in levels of oxygenation of blood due to biochemistry and physics that are too complicated for this
- We can use these images to see what parts of the brain are active at certain times during the scan (indirectly using the signal from the blood flow, or BOLD signal)
- 

fMRI works almost the same as structural MRI, but has two key differences:

1. Images are taken more frequently to improve temporal resolution
   - (so instead of an image taken every minute, an image would be taken every couple of seconds).
2. There is lower spatial resolution

Temporal and spatial resolution both sit on one end of a sliding scale, and typically improving one will hurt the other. This is something that is changed based on goals and methods of the study being conducted.

   

While you may not find this video to be the most exhilarating, it is packed with useful information and very well done. This covers all of the basics in measuring the bold signal, HRF, and factors that can affect scans.
