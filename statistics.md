# Statistics

Before we go and get our hands dirty with the data, it’s important to learn some of the statistics that lie behind many of the analyses. For those of you who are new to research, you will have to learn statistics for almost any field, so you might as well do it with something cool like cognitive neuroscience! 

There are whole classes dedicated to this, so rather than do that, I am going to say some of the topics you need to be familiar with and provide a crash course for them.

As you will see later, R is a coding language designed for statistical analyses. You must either learn [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) or [SPSS](https://www.ibm.com/products/spss-statistics/gradpack?adoper=227628_2&adobe_mc_sdid=SDID%3D1AB64E5E0B2F7971-42F2EFA8A7ABBE5E%7CMCORGID%3DD10F27705ED7F5130A495C99%40AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1718313775&adobe_mc_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F)(or[JASP](https://jasp-stats.org/) as a free alternative to SPSS) to conduct many of the analyses that you will learn about. The only exception to this is if you already know how to use another language like MATLAB or Python for advanced statistics.

Below, the most important topics are listed. In parentheses will be  the corresponding chapter in [Andy Field’s Discovering Statistics Using IBM SPSS Statistics](http://repo.darmajaya.ac.id/5678/1/Discovering%20Statistics%20Using%20IBM%20SPSS%20Statistics%20%28%20PDFDrive%20%29.pdf). Dr. Jamil Palacios Bhanji from Rutgers University Newark has created an incredible psychology statistics course with interactive R activities that will teach you both about statistics and how to code in R.  Below the topics will be links to the corresponding R Activities which I *strongly recommend doing*. Statistics knowledge and being able to apply it with R is a very useful skill that will get you far in any field of research because (almost, didn't fact check this) every field of research relies on it. The full course and activities can be found [here](https://jamilfelipe.github.io/psych596/activities/full-list.html).
