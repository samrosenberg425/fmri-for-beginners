# How an MRI works

MRI stands Magnetic Resonance Imaging, which probably doesn't mean much to you now but will by the end of this module! 

If you bet that I was going to actually be the one writing all of this material, then you would probably lose that bet. This article does a good job at explaining how an MRI works and if a lot of it doesn’t make sense, that is *okay*. You do *not* need to be an MRI physicist by the end of this but just have a basic idea of how we go from putting a person in the scanner to looking a pretty image of their brain:

**[Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (article) - Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/human-biology/neuron-nervous-system/a/magnetic-resonance-imaging-mri)**

Now that you have read some about how an MRI works, these videos are great for reinforcing the concepts through helpful animations since not everyone intuitively imagines what proton precessions look like(by not everyone, I mean no one). The videos below are in order of increasing level of detail(aka the top is easiest and the bottom is the hardest) since there will be people with different levels of background knowledge.

- **[MRI in 10 Minutes!](https://youtu.be/jLnuPKhKXVM?si=K08V18WdL5oLSaco)** This is all you need. It can give you a basic idea of how exactly an MRI works. Since it would be pretty embarrassing to say you work with MRIs but when asked how they work, have no idea and pretend you do until you cave and admit to them you just work with the data and don’t know…who would ever get caught in that situation? 
- **[MRI in Just Under 10 Minutes!](https://youtu.be/1Ku6-uXw7Ag?si=eUFo5yEXmpEOQl4f)** This is a slightly less fun version of the video above, but it does do a better job at explaining the physics behind MRIs which for anyone who’s more of a math/science type of student.
- **[Super In Detail For the Engineers](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkSVzqeK5v2C4X1G3IuRUQeNveNGNxZrn&si=2QvvOv37GIvj9gUC)**: Unless you have a strong physics and mathematics background and a few hours time, don’t bother torturing yourself with this. This is very in detail on the mechanisms/equations that drive how an MRI is taken.
